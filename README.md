# Swirl-FEM: Differentiable Finite Element Simulations in JAX
*This is not an officially supported Google product.*

This library provides a lightweight and flexible framework for higher order
finite element simulations on unstructured quadrilateral or hexahedral meshes.

We primarily focus on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations, with
experimental support for running in a distributed setting on Google's Tensor
Processing Units (TPUs).
